A CLI to change a file's creation date


I created this as a little beginner's excercise for learning C# and how to use Commandline Parser.

You can do with it whatever you want and of course there's no warranty for anything.

If you have feedback on how I coded this, I'd be very eager to hear from you. I'm essentially a beginner who uses some minor programming skills for data analysis at work and as a hobby.

Cheers,
